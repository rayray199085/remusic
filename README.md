In this project, I followed the online project 'remusic' to build the interface and realized its partial functions.

1. Sorting the local music files by their names, singers, albums and parent files.

2. Recording recent play songs and bookmark a list of songs by database.

3. Add animation when opening the app.

4. Add a floating window at the bottom of the screen with buttons to play, pause, next, previous songs, 

   and add songs to the favourite list. It also includes album image, Song title and singer name.

I used view page indicator from (https://github.com/JakeWharton/ViewPagerIndicator) to for view pagers.
